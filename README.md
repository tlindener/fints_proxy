# fints_proxy
A simple proxy to access HBCI/FinTS based services through a REST API.

Allows getting account balance and transactions. It also supports DKB creditcards. No caching of account details is used for security reasons. 

## Limitations
HBCI sometimes is rather slow...

## Warning
Don't use without https if not running locally!
